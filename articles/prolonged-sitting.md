# Taking frequent walking breaks during prolonged sitting could help lower blood sugar and BP

1. Sedentary lifestyle with prolonged sitting hours (>8 hours daily) is common these days. Frequent walking breaks (1 min or 5 min every 30-60 minutes) could help lower blood sugar and BP.
2. When participants took a 5-minute light #walk after every half hour of sitting, the blood #glucose spike after eating was reduced by 58% compared with sitting all day (reduction one would see in a diabetic using insulin or #diabetes medications to control their blood sugar).
3. The largest reductions in systolic blood pressure were observed when the walking break was 1 minute every 60 minutes (-5.2 mm Hg).
4. The take-away message is that "if you have a job or a lifestyle where you have to sit for long periods of time, you should take a 5-minute walking break every half hour. That's one behavior change that could reduce your health risks from sitting."
5. Conclusion: Higher frequency and longer duration breaks (every 30 min for 5 min) should be considered when targeting glycemic (glucose) responses, while lower doses (every 60 min for 1 min) may be sufficient for BP lowering.  Ref: Medscape Jan 12 2023  #MedTwitter
